As i am outside campus and don't have vpn i cannot access the moodle hence i am putting observations for google web page

a]HTML uses a hierarchical structure where elements are nested within each other, forming a tree-like representation.

The basic structure of html looks like a tree and have elements nested inside each others
ex 
<html>
      <head></head>
        <body>
          
        </body>
</html>
As we can see in the image  ![image](https://github.com/Parth09090/summer-of-code-2023/assets/137100541/fe250321-670d-474b-a1cc-dd4082c54312)

inside the html tag there is a body tag inside which there is a div element inside which there are various div ,script etc elements
Indeed it forms a tree like a structure there is a main tag in which all of it's written like the tree's trunk then there are other tags like the branches which have tags inside them like small branches to the final leaves.

b]After selecting a element
I was able to edit some properties and also create some new properties to that element in the devtool

As shown in the image after unchecking the align-items to center check box the Google shifted to left 
i was also able to change properties like font size font-style and it affected the grey color box in which about etc things are written
I also manged to change the background color behind the ggogle log to light blue

I was also able to add a border to the login box and increase it's padding which is the breathing space around the element

changed backgroud color to black 
Yeah so we can change totally how the page looks by using the devtools to by changing and editing the properties
